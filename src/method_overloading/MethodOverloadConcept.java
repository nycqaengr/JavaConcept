    //****Method Overloading***********
    //Same method name with different parameters within the same Class.
    //There are two ways to overload the method in java:
    //1.By changing number of arguments or parameters
    //2.By changing the data type
    //We can't create a method inside a method and can't create duplicate method
    //sum method is overload under
    //We can overload main method.
    //It is similar to constructor overloading in Java.
    //Note: In Java, Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.
