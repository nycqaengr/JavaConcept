//						***Recursive Method******
//A method that call itself is known as recursive method and this technique is known as recursion
//A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other>>
//Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.
//Syntax: returntype methodname(){
//code to be executed
//methodname();//calling same method
//The recursion continues until some condition is met to prevent it from execution>>
//If not, infinite recursion occurs.
//Hence, to prevent infinite recursion, if...else statement (or similar approach)>>
//can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and other doesn't.
//Advantage & disadvantage:
//When a recursive call is made, new storage location for variables are allocated on the stack.
//As, each recursive call returns, the old variables and parameters are removed from the stack.
//Hence, recursion generally use more memory and are generally slow.
//On the other hand, recursive solution is much simpler and takes less time to write, debug and maintain.
