    //Generally, String is a sequence of characters.
    //But in Java, String basically an object that represent sequence of char value.
    //An Array characters works same as Java String
    //char[] ch = {"N","U","R","U","L",};
    //String s = new String[ch];
    //OR String s = "Java Point";
    //The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.
    //Java String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on string such as
    //compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.
    //The java.lang.String class implements Serializable, Comparable and CharSequence interfaces.
    //The Java String is immutable which means it cannot be changed. Whenever we change any string,
    //a new instance is created. For mutable strings, you can use StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes.
    //How to create a string object---1) By Literal & 2) By new key word
    //String Literal---String s = "Java"
    //Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the "string constant pool" first.
    //If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned.
    //If the string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool.
    //Note: String objects are stored in a special memory area known as the "string constant pool".
    //For example:
    //String s1 = "welcome";
    //String s2 = "welcome";//it doesn't create a new instance in "string constant pool"
    //Why Java uses the concept of String literal?
    //To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created
    //if it exists already in the string constant pool).
    //By new keyword---String s=new String("Welcome");//creates two objects and one reference variable
    //In such case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memory,
    //and the literal "Welcome" will be placed in the string constant pool.
    //The variable s will refer to the object in a heap (non-pool).
    //Why are string object are immutable?
    //In java, string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.
    //Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.
    //Why string objects are immutable in java?
    //Because java uses the concept of string literal.Suppose there are 5 reference variables,
    //all referes to one object "sachin".If one reference variable changes the value of the object,
    //it will be affected to all the reference variables. That is why string objects are immutable in java.

    public static void main (String[]args){
        String s1 = "Mahmud";
        s1.concat("Nurul");//concat method appends the string at the end
        System.out.println(s1);//will print Mahmud because strings are immutable objects

        String s2 = "Nurul";
        s1.concat("Mahmud");
        System.out.println(s2);
    }
