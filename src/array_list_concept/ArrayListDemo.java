    //Arraylist---dynamic array---we don't define the size.
//The ArrayList class implements the List interface.
//It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types.
//The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order and is non synchronized.
//Allows random access to fetch the element because it store values on the basis of indexes.
//only store one object.
//Arraylist allows you to remove elements, but array doesn't provide such methods.
