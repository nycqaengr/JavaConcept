//this keyword in java
//Usage of java this keyword

//"this" keyword can be use in two ways.
//this . (this dot)
//this() (this off)

//this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
//this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
//this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
//this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
//this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
//this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.

//The scope of "this" keyword is within the class. it always point to the current class object.
//The main purpose of using "this" keyword in real life application is to differentiate variable of class or formal parameters of methods or constructor
//(it is highly recommended using the same variable name either in a class or method and constructor while working with similar objects).

//Note: If any variable is preceded by "this" JVM treated that variable as class variable.

public class Employee {

    String name;
    int age;
    int id;

    public Employee(String name, int age, int id) {
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
        this.id=id;
    }

    public void displayInformation() {
        System.out.println(name+" "+age+" "+id);
    }

    //In the above example, parameters (formal arguments) and instance variables are same.
    //>>So, we are using this keyword to distinguish local variable and instance variable.
