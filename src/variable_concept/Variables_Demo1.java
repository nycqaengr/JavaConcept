//Java Variable
//Variables are containers for storing data values.
//In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

//String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
//int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
//float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
//char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
//boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

//A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.

//To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
//Syntax: type variable = value;
// int data = 50; here data is variable

public class Variables_Demo1 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Nurul Mahmud";
        System.out.println(name+"\n");

        int myNum = 15;
        System.out.println(myNum+"\n");

        //Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
        int myNum1=20;
        myNum1=25;//now myNum1 is 25
        System.out.println(myNum1+"\n");

        //Declare Many Variables
        //To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:
        int x=5, y=10, z=15;
        System.out.println(x+y+z);

        System.out.println("\n");
        //Final Variables
        //However, you can add the final keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values (this will
        //declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
        final int num= 50;
        //num= 60;//// will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable

        //Other types of variables
        int number = 5;
        float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
        char myLetter = 'D';
        boolean myBool = true;
        String myText = "Hello";
