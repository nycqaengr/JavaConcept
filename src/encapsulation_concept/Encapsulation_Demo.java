    //	*********************
//Encapsulation is a process of wrapping of data and methods in a single unit and
//protecting data by declaring them as a private.
//Private data will be hidden from other classes and they can only be accessed through
//the method of their current classes, this is called data hiding.
//How to do Encapsulation?
//1) Declare the variable as private---so that these variables cannot be accessed directly from outside of the class
//2) Provide public getter and setter method to SET AND GET THE VALUES OF VARIABLES/FIELDS.
//The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
//Benefits of Encapsulation:
//1) Provides data hiding. 2)Re-usability 3) Code can be modified without breaking the code.
