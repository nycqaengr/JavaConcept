    //Why Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only?
    //In java, method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only because of ambiguity. Let's see how ambiguity may occur:

public class Sum {

    public static int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static double sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Sum.sum(10, 10));// ambiguity
        // Here, how can java determine which sum() method should be called?
        // Note: Compile Time Error is better than Run Time Error.
        // So, java compiler renders compiler time error if you declare the same method
        // having same parameters.
    }
}
