    //						POLYMORPHISM
//				****************************
//The process of representing one form in multiple forms is known as Polymorphism.
//Many forms (one to many method---method overriding)
//Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
//Two types---1) Compile type/Static or Early binding 2) Run Time/Dynamic/Late Binding
//Polymorphism is a mechanism where a parent class variable can take many forms
//(it can refer object from different classes).
//Child class object can be referred by parent class reference variable
//dynamic polymorphismâ€”run time polymorphism. Car c = new BMW();
//How to achieve polymorphism in Java?
//Static polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overloading and
//Dynamic polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overriding
