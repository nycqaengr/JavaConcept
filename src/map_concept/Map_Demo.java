    //Java Map is an Interface
    //A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.
    //A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
    //Java Map Hierarchy
    //There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three classes:
    //HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.
    //A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values.
    //HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
