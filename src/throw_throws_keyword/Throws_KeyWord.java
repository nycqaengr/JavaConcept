    //used to handle the exception but we don't report anything
    //there is no option for report anything
    //The throws keyword is used to indicates what exception type may be thrown by a method.
    //The "throws" is used to throw an exception for a method
    //What is the need of having throws keyword when you can handle exception using try-catch?
    //We already know we can handle exceptions using try-catch block.
    //The throws does the same thing that try-catch does but there are some cases where you would
    //prefer throws over try-catch. For example: Lets say we have a method myMethod() that has statements
    //that can throw either ArithmeticException or NullPointerException, in this case you can use try-catch.
    //But suppose you have several such methods that can cause exceptions, in that case it would be tedious to
    //write these try-catch for each method. The code will become unnecessary long and will be less-readable.
    //One way to overcome this problem is by using throws like this: declare the exceptions in the method
    //signature using throws and handle the exceptions where you are calling this method by using try-catch.
