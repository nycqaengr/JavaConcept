    // Execute a statement or group of statement multiple times.
    //Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

    //There are three types of loop
    //1. for loop 2. while loop 3. do-while loop
    //for loop:The java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. if the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommeded to use for loop.
    //while loop: The java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. if the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommeded to use while loop.
    //do-while loop: The java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times.If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use the do-while loop.

    //Concept:
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
    //System.out.println("Let me go");
